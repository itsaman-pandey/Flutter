# 🚀 Flutter Development Journey

Welcome to my Flutter projects repository!  
This folder contains apps and experiments as I learn and master **Flutter** and **Dart**, focusing on building beautiful and functional cross-platform mobile applications.

---

## 📚 Learning Path

### 📦 What I'm Exploring:

- **Dart Fundamentals**
  - Variables, functions, control flow
  - Classes, constructors, mixins
  - Futures, async/await, Streams

- **Flutter Core Concepts**
  - Widgets: Stateless & Stateful
  - Navigation and routing
  - The widget tree and build lifecycle
  - Layouts using `Column`, `Row`, `Stack`, `Expanded`, etc.

- **UI & UX Design**
  - Material Design components
  - Theming, gradients, and fonts
  - Animations and transitions
  - Responsive layouts

- **State Management (basics for now)**
  - `setState()`
  - Passing data between widgets
  - Stateful logic encapsulation

- **Asset Management**
  - Image assets
  - Fonts and icons
  - `pubspec.yaml` organization

- **Dart OOP Concepts in Practice**
  - Encapsulation through private variables
  - Factory constructors
  - Inheritance & abstraction

---

## 🧠 Current Focus Areas

- Building intuitive UI/UX
- Implementing smooth animations
- Understanding widget rebuilds
- Organizing code into reusable components

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m learning Flutter with a hands-on, project-based approach.  
My goal is to build fast, beautiful, and meaningful mobile apps using a strong foundation in Dart and Flutter.

## 📈 What's Next?

- Explore packages like `provider`, `http`, `audioplayers`, etc.
- Learn about API integration
- Explore advanced state management
- Try animations with `AnimatedBuilder`, `Hero`, and custom transitions
